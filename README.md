Q5. Example of High Homogeneity but Low Completeness
Example: Suppose in a clustering result, all samples from class A are correctly grouped into Cluster 1, achieving high homogeneity. However, Cluster 1 also includes samples from class B, leading to low completeness because not all samples from class B are assigned to a single cluster.
Q6. Using V-measure for Optimal Number of Clusters
Process: Compute V-measure for different numbers of clusters.
Objective: Identify the number of clusters that maximizes V-measure, indicating a balance between homogeneity and completeness.
Q7. Advantages and Disadvantages of Silhouette Coefficient
Advantages: Easy to interpret, works well with different cluster shapes and densities.
Disadvantages: Sensitive to noise and outliers, may not perform well with non-convex clusters.
Q8. Limitations of Davies-Bouldin Index
Limitations: Assumes clusters as spherical and equally distributed, sensitive to the number of clusters.
Overcoming: Normalize data, consider alternatives for non-spherical clusters.
Q9. Relationship Between Homogeneity, Completeness, and V-measure
Relationship: Homogeneity and completeness are components of V-measure.
Values: V-measure can differ from homogeneity and completeness separately due to their harmonic mean formulation.
Q10. Using Silhouette Coefficient for Comparing Clustering Algorithms
Comparison: Calculate Silhouette Coefficient for different algorithms on the same dataset.
Issues: Interpret results cautiously; algorithms may perform differently based on data characteristics like density and dimensionality.
Q11. Davies-Bouldin Index for Separation and Compactness
Measurement: Evaluates how well-defined and distinct clusters are (separation) and how tightly packed the points within each cluster are (compactness).
Assumptions: Assumes clusters as convex and symmetrical, impacting results for non-standard clusters.
Q12. Using Silhouette Coefficient for Hierarchical Clustering
Applicability: Yes, Silhouette Coefficient can evaluate clusters in hierarchical clustering.
Procedure: Compute distances and cluster memberships at each level of hierarchy for evaluation.
